# Objective-C KVO Memory Management Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  Failure to remove KVO observers when they are no longer needed can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior, especially in complex applications.

The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code, where an observer is not removed. The `bugSolution.m` demonstrates the correct approach, highlighting how to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper observer removal.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe the behavior and compare it to the solution.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` method to explicitly remove the observer when it's no longer needed.  This prevents the observer from retaining the observed object, avoiding potential memory leaks and crashes.
